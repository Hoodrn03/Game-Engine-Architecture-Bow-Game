# Game Engine Game

This project will be for the module Game Engine Architecture. The module will 
require us to design and build a game using a homemade game engine. 

Before progress is made unique branches will need to be made for each person 
working on the project. If anyone needs help with setting up github or 
their branches (Especcially during the merging process) please contact Ryan 
Hood either by text or email (at Hoodrn03@gmail.com).

Created TurnState class with enum to check for turns in the game;
Created NPC_Character class, in which AI behaviour will be programmed;
Added in PlayerCharacter camera switching code and pseudocode for switching turns(for now)
Added NPC_Character pseudocode of AI behaviour;
Created base of AI_Component.

Basically, I am planning out structure of everything

Notes: CameraViewState first and third view cameras should be deleted later on

Created TurnState class with enum to check for turns in the game;
Created NPC_Character class, in which AI behaviour will be programmed;
Added in PlayerCharacter camera switching code and pseudocode for switching turns(for now)
Added NPC_Character pseudocode of AI behaviour;
Created base of AI_Component.

Basically, I am planning out structure of everything

Notes: CameraViewState first and third view cameras should be deleted later on

Implemented first AI behaviour(not tested yet)
Implemented Sender class with static variables to pass in messages between Player and NPC objects
